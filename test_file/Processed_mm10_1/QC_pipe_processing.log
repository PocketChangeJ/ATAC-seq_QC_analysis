step3.2, normalization process done
step3.4, macs2 peak calling process done
step4.1, reads unpder peak ratio calculation process done
step4.1.2, insertion site process done
Warning: the open.bed file contains less than 10M reads
Warning: the enrichment is calculated by the original bed file, and may not be reliable
step4.2.1, sub10M enrichment ratio process done
step4.2.2, coding promoter enrichment ratio process done
step4.4, saturation subsampling process done
step4.5, saturation call peak process done
step4.5, saturation results collection process done
Warning: total peak is fewer than 100, promoter bin step would be skipped. At least 100 peaks are required.
