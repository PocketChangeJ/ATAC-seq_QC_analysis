###
This forlder is to test TaRGET code locally.


All scripts are same to the "pipe_code" folder, which is frequently used in the server, except:
1. The code is slight different: TaRGET vs AIAP
2. The visualization is different: score matrix


All scripts are same to the TaRGET code folder in Singularity (which is used for the TaRGET AWS server), except:
1. The "qc_source.sh", which is adjusted to different file structure
